# Exercice

A laser printer uses a laser beam to print copy rapidly for a computer. The laser is positioned by a control input $r(t)$, so that we have:

$$
Y(s) = \frac{4(s+50)}{s ^2 + 30s +200}R(s)
$$
The input $r(t)$ represents the desired position of the laser beam. 

+ (a) If $r(t)$  is a unit step input, find the output $y(t)$. 

+ (b) What is the final value of $y(t)$?

+ (c) Utilize the Mason formula to construct the SFG of this system.

+ (d) Deduce the diagram of the blocks.
