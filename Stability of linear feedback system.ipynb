    "# Introduction \n",
    "The stability of closed-loop feedback systems is crucial in control system design. A stable system should produce a bounded output for any bounded input, a principle known as bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stability. This stability relates to the roots of the characteristic equation of the system's transfer function and the eigenvalues of the system transition matrix in state-variable format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Routh–Hurwitz method is a valuable tool for assessing stability, allowing us to identify the number of roots in the right half-plane without calculating their exact values. This aids in designing parameters to achieve closed-loop stability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will explore relative stability, which characterizes the level of stability in systems. This section wraps up with a stabilizing controller design based on the Routh–Hurwitz method, demonstrated in the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.\n",

    "# Concept of stability\n",
    "Stability is essential in designing and analyzing feedback control systems. An unstable closed-loop feedback system offers little practical value, so all our control designs must ensure closed-loop stability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical systems are inherently open-loop unstable, and some, like modern fighter aircraft, are intentionally designed this way. Without active feedback control, these aircraft cannot fly. Engineers implement active control to stabilize these systems, allowing for effective management of factors like transient performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback is used to stabilize both unstable and stable systems, enabling adjustments to meet design specifications such as steady-state tracking errors, percent overshoot, settling time, and time to peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closed-loop feedback system can be classified as stable or unstable, a concept known as absolute stability. When a system is stable, we can assess its degree of stability, referred to as relative stability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early aircraft designers recognized that greater stability made an aircraft harder to maneuver. Conversely, modern acrobatic aircraft are intentionally less stable, allowing for quicker turns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine absolute stability, we check that all poles of the transfer function or eigenvalues of the system transition matrix A lie in the left half of the s-plane. Once confirmed, we can analyze relative stability by examining their relative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Definition 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> ==A stable system is a dynamic system with bounded response to a bounded input.\n",
    "> A linear system is stable if and only if the absolute value of its impulse response $h_{cl}(t)$, integrated over an infinite range, is finite. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\vert h_{cl}(t)\\vert dt <\\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of linear systems, we recognize that the stability requirement may be defined in terms of the location of the poles of the closed-loop transfer function. A closed-loop system transfer function can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{cl}(s)=\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}=K \\frac{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{M}(s+z_{i})}{\\prod\\limits_{k=1}^{Q}(s+\\sigma_{k})\\prod\\limits_{l=1}^{R}(s²+2\\alpha_{l}s+\\alpha_{l}²+\\omega_{l}²)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The characteristic equation of this system is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D(s)=0\\Rightarrow \\exists\\; r_{i}\\in\\mathbb{C}\\;\\vert\\;D(r_{i})=0\n",

    "$$\n",
    "For the output $y(t)$ to be bounded, the poles of the system must be located in the left half of the s-plane. Therefore, *a necessary and sufficient condition for a feedback system to be asymptotically stable is that all the poles of its transfer function have negative real parts. Conversely, a feedback system will be unstable if there is at least one pole whose real part is not negative. If some poles of the feedback system are located on the imaginary axis of the s-plane, then the system is considered to be marginally stable.*\n",
