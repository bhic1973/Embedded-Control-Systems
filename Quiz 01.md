| 1. A closed-loop control system uses a measurement of the output and a feedback of the signal to compare it with the desired input.                                                                                                                                                 |       True       | False |
| 2. Engineering synthesis and engineering analysis are the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       True       | False |
| 3. The block diagram in below is an example of a closed-loop feedback system: ![[diag73.svg]]                                                                                                                                                                                       |       True       | False |
